📊 Agency Performance KPI Dashboard

📌 Project originally developed in a professional environment for performance monitoring across a network of multiple agencies.
This public version has been fully anonymized and rebuilt to highlight my expertise in:
Power Query • Excel • PowerPivot • DAX • Data Modeling • Business Intelligence • KPI Automation.

📊 Professional BI Dashboard built end-to-end for executive performance monitoring

🎯 Recruiter-Focused Summary

This project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and maintain complete Excel-based Business Intelligence solutions for real-world operational needs.
Originally created in a corporate environment for multi-agency performance tracking, this public version recreates the full logic, architecture, automation, and analytics while keeping all sensitive data removed.

👤 My Role

I independently managed the full lifecycle of this BI solution:
Requirements gathering with business teams
Designing KPIs and performance indicators
Building the data model (PowerPivot)
Developing ETL pipelines with Power Query
Implementing DAX calculations for KPIs, YTD, and variance analysis
Creating interactive dashboards and user-friendly navigation
Securing the Excel file (VBA protection, locked structure, controlled user inputs)

➡️ This project highlights my ability to deliver production-ready BI tools used daily by non-technical business users.

🚀 What This Project Demonstrates About My Skills
🧩 1. End-to-End Data Workflow Ownership

I built the entire workflow:
Extract → Transform → Load (Power Query)
Data modeling (PowerPivot)
KPIs & measures (DAX)
Visualization & interaction (Excel dashboards + slicers)
Automation & refresh logic (VBA + Power Query)

➡️ Demonstrates my capacity to design full BI systems autonomously.

🎯 2. Strong Data Modeling & KPI Logic

Normalization of raw operational data
Segmentation logic (branches, sites, usages, mutuelles)
YTD / YoY variance calculations
Multi-level dynamic filtering & cross-analysis

➡️ Shows advanced analytical and KPI engineering skills.

📈 3. Business Impact

This dashboard enables:

Better monitoring of agency performance
Faster and more reliable decision-making
Standardized metrics shared across stakeholders
Significant time savings through automation
Clear visibility on objectives and variances

➡️ Demonstrates strong business understanding.

🛠 4. Technical Skills Practiced

Power Query (M language, ETL automation)
PowerPivot (data model, relationships)
DAX (YTD, YoY, variance, KPIs)
Excel (advanced dashboards, slicers, visuals)
VBA (secured structure, automation)
Data Cleaning & Standardization
Dataset performance optimization

➡️ Matches BI Analyst & Data Analyst skill expectations.

🧪 5. Professional-Grade Delivery

Protected Excel structure (locked sheets + protected VBA project)
Clean and documented architecture
Real-world business rules
Optimized refresh performance

➡️ Shows high standards of BI delivery.

⭐ In Short

A complete demonstration of my ability to build professional BI systems, combining business understanding, technical skills, and clean execution.
